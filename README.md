# README - Pac-Man Ghost AI Search Project

## Introduction

This project, part of CS14003: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, focuses on implementing search algorithms to control ghosts in a Pac-Man environment. The goal is to analyze their efficiency using BFS, DFS, UCS, and A* based on search time, memory usage, and expanded nodes.

## Language and Libraries

**Programming Language:** Python (>=3.8)

**Required Libraries:**

- `pygame`: Handles game visualization and interaction.
- `heapq`: Supports priority queue operations for UCS and A* search.

## Installation
- Step 1: Ensure Python 3.8 or later is installed on your system.
- Step 2: Install the required libraries using the following command:
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Note: 
The `requirements.txt` file includes the following dependencies:

`pygame numpy matplotlib heapq`

If requirements.txt is not available, manually install them independently.

## Complication:
- Step 1: Download 23127075_23127130_23127203_23127423.zip or from the link in the report.pdf and unzip it.
- Step 2: Download VS Code and Python with its necessary libraries.
- Step 3: Open the main folder / repository.
- Step 4: Navigate to the source folder and choose main.py.
- Step 5: Press the Run button in VS Code.
